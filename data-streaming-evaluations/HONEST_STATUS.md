# Honest Status: What We Can Actually Test

## Current Reality (October 24, 2025, 13:00)

### What We HAVE:
✓ Working coordinator with NTP/ChronoTick support (code complete)
✓ Working workers with NTP/ChronoTick support (code complete)
✓ NTP proxy running on ARES (172.20.1.1:8123)
✓ Deployment scripts ready
✓ Analysis framework ready

### What We DON'T HAVE:
✗ **ChronoTick MCP server is NOT running**
✗ Workers currently use fallback ChronoTick (offset=0, uncertainty=15ms)
✗ This fallback is NOT a valid test of ChronoTick

## What We Can Test RIGHT NOW

### Test 1: System Clock vs NTP Ground Truth ✓ READY

**What this tests:**
- NTP establishes ground truth ordering: `coord_ntp_send < worker_ntp_recv`
- System clock comparison: Does `coord_system < worker_system` agree?
- Measures: How often does raw system clock violate NTP ground truth?

**Why this is valuable:**
- Shows baseline without any time synchronization
- Demonstrates need for better timing
- Valid comparison (both use NTP as reference)

**What this does NOT test:**
- ChronoTick (server not running)
- Fuzzy clock semantics
- Uncertainty bounds
- Commit-wait

**Honest expectation:**
- Low violation rate (0-5%) on synchronized cluster
- System clocks are already pretty good in data center
- Not dramatically different from NTP because clocks are close

### Test 2: Full ChronoTick Evaluation ✗ NOT READY

**What this WOULD test:**
- ChronoTick uncertainty bounds vs NTP ground truth
- Fuzzy clock semantics (provable, ambiguous, violation)
- Commit-wait uncertainty reduction
- Window assignment with uncertainty quantification

**Why we CAN'T test this:**
- ChronoTick MCP server not running on ARES
- No real ChronoTick timestamps available
- Fallback mode is meaningless for evaluation

**What we need:**
1. Build ChronoTick MCP server environment on ARES
2. Start daemon process
3. Expose on HTTP port (e.g., 8124)
4. Configure workers/coordinator to use it

## Proposed Path Forward

### Option A: Test System Clock Now, ChronoTick Later

1. **Now (10 min):**
   - Run system clock vs NTP ground truth test
   - Get baseline violation measurements
   - Validate test framework works correctly

2. **Later (requires setup):**
   - Set up ChronoTick MCP server on ARES
   - Run full evaluation with all three timestamps
   - Compare system clock vs ChronoTick vs ground truth

### Option B: Set Up ChronoTick First

1. **Setup (30-60 min):**
   - Install ChronoTick dependencies on ARES
   - Start ChronoTick MCP server
   - Verify connectivity from compute nodes
   - Run warmup period

2. **Test (30-60 min):**
   - Full evaluation with all three timestamps
   - Complete analysis with fuzzy semantics
   - Publication-quality results

## The Honest Experimental Design

### Ground Truth Establishment

```
For each event:
  Coordinator sends at time T_send
    - Queries NTP: coord_ntp = T_send + ntp_offset_coord

  Worker receives at time T_recv
    - Queries NTP: worker_ntp = T_recv + ntp_offset_worker

  Ground truth: coord_ntp < worker_ntp (should be true)
```

### Comparison 1: System Clock

```
Question: Does raw system clock respect ground truth?

Ground truth says: coord_ntp < worker_ntp
System clock says: T_send < T_recv

Violation if: T_recv < T_send (but coord_ntp < worker_ntp)
```

### Comparison 2: ChronoTick (when available)

```
Question: Do ChronoTick bounds respect ground truth?

Ground truth says: coord_ntp < worker_ntp
ChronoTick bounds:
  - Coordinator: [coord_ct - 3σ, coord_ct + 3σ]
  - Worker: [worker_ct - 3σ, worker_ct + 3σ]

Classification:
  1. coord_ct_upper < worker_ct_lower → Provably ordered ✓
  2. Bounds overlap → Ambiguous (fuzzy semantics) ✓
  3. worker_ct_upper < coord_ct_lower → VIOLATION ✗
```

## What We Won't Claim

**We will NOT say:**
- "NTP has X% violations" (NTP is the ground truth!)
- "ChronoTick is better than NTP" (different purposes)
- Results from fallback ChronoTick are meaningful

**We WILL say:**
- "System clock has X% violations vs NTP ground truth"
- "ChronoTick respects causality with Y% provable, Z% ambiguous"
- "Uncertainty quantification enables better distributed semantics"

## Recommendation

**Start with Test 1** (system clock vs NTP ground truth):
- Validates framework
- Gets baseline measurements
- Takes 30-40 minutes
- Doesn't require ChronoTick setup

**Then decide** if we want to invest in full ChronoTick setup for Test 2.

**Question for you:** Which path do you want to take?

A) Run system clock baseline test now (quick, validates framework)
B) Set up ChronoTick MCP server first (slower, complete evaluation)
C) Something else?
