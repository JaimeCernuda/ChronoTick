## ‚è≥ CURRENT STATUS

**Model Loading in Progress** (Expected: 5-10 minutes)

The system is currently loading TimesFM model from local cache. The Hugging Face connection errors are expected since comp-12 has no internet access. The model loader will retry and eventually fall back to cached models.

**Timeline**:
- 23:10:45 - V3 started
- 23:11-23:15 - HuggingFace retries (expected, will timeout and use cache)
- 23:15-23:20 - Model loading from cache (estimated)
- 23:20-23:23 - Warmup phase (3 minutes)
- 23:23+ - Normal operation with predictions

## üìä V3 Features Deployed

### Fix 1: Add Drift Term
```python
time_delta = system_time - prediction_time
chronotick_time_fix1 = system_time + offset + drift_rate * time_delta
```

### Fix 2: NTP-Anchored Time Walking (Chrony-Inspired)
```python
elapsed = system_time - last_ntp_system_time
chronotick_time_fix2 = last_ntp_true_time + elapsed + drift_rate * elapsed
```

### Enhanced CSV Columns
- `chronotick_time_fix1` - Fix 1 result
- `chronotick_time_fix2` - Fix 2 result (NTP-anchored)
- `chronotick_drift_rate` - Drift in s/s
- `chronotick_prediction_time` - When prediction was made
- `time_since_ntp_s` - Seconds since NTP anchor

### Enhanced Logging
```
[60s] üì° NTP: offset=+3.42ms ¬± 0.85ms (combined 4/5, MAD=0.23ms)
      ChronoTick (Fix1): offset=+3.45ms, drift=+1.234Œºs/s, source=fusion
      Fix1 vs NTP: +0.123ms | Fix2 vs NTP: -0.056ms
```

## üîç Monitoring Commands

### Check if V3 is running:
```bash
ssh ares 'ssh ares-comp-12 "ps aux | grep client_driven_validation_v3"'
```

### Monitor log (real-time):
```bash
ssh ares 'ssh ares-comp-12 "tail -f /tmp/experiment11_v3_comp12_20251023_231036.log | grep -E \"NTP:|ChronoTick|Fix\""'
```

### Check CSV:
```bash
ssh ares 'ssh ares-comp-12 "ls -lh /tmp/chronotick_client_validation*.csv"'
```

### Verify predictions working:
```bash
ssh ares 'ssh ares-comp-12 "tail -20 /tmp/chronotick_client_validation*.csv"'
```

## üéØ Expected Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 23:10 | V3 deployment started |
| 23:20 | Model loading complete (estimated) |
| 23:23 | Warmup complete, predictions start |
| 23:24 | First NTP measurement (60s after start) |
| 23:25 | Fix 2 NTP anchor established |
| 02:10 | V3 experiment completes (3 hours) |

---

## üìä Comparison Plan

Once experiments complete:

**comp-11 (V2 - baseline)**:
- No drift correction
- Single time output

**comp-12 (V3 - experimental)**:
- Fix 1: Uses drift (system-clock-based)
- Fix 2: NTP-anchored (independent)
- Dual time outputs for comparison

### Metrics to Compare:
1. Mean absolute error vs NTP
2. Std deviation vs NTP
3. V2 vs V3 Fix1 vs V3 Fix2
4. Improvement percentages

---

## üìù Key Discoveries Documented

1. **Drift is CALCULATED from NTP** (not ML-predicted)
   - Window-based linear regression over 10 NTP measurements
   - Fallback: approximate from consecutive predictions

2. **Fix 2 is Chrony-Inspired**
   - Chrony: drift-based correction, never step clock
   - Fix 2: walk from NTP anchor with drift
   - Independent from system clock jumps

3. **Client & Server Issues**
   - Client: Not using drift_rate (Fix 1 solves)
   - Server: Models OFFSET not TRUE_TIME (harder fix)

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Wait for model loading** (~5-10 min from 23:10)
2. **Monitor warmup** (check logs at 23:23)
3. **Verify predictions** (check CSV at 23:25)
4. **Let run for 3 hours** (until 02:10)
5. **Analyze results** (compare V2 vs V3 Fix1 vs V3 Fix2)

---

## üéì Summary

**V3 Implementation**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Deployment**: ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS
**Model Loading**: ‚è≥ WAITING (~5 min remaining)
**Expected Success**: ‚úÖ HIGH (same environment as V2, just enhanced)

All code is tested, committed, and deployed. The system is now loading models and should begin collecting data within 10 minutes. The 3-hour experiment will provide comprehensive comparison data for all three approaches (V2, Fix1, Fix2).

**Manual check recommended**: At 23:25 UTC to verify predictions are being recorded correctly.
