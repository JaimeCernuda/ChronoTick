## 🐛 Known Issues (Minor)

1. **Long-term model warning:** 
   - `WARNING | Insufficient data for long-term prediction`
   - **Impact:** None (short-term model working perfectly)
   - **Cause:** 12 measurements insufficient for 240-step horizon
   - **Fix:** Not needed - dual-model fusion gracefully degrades to single model

## 📝 Conclusion

**ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL** ✅

ChronoTick is functioning as a complete end-to-end ML-powered time synchronization system:

- ✅ Real NTP measurements (not synthetic)
- ✅ ML predictions with Chronos-Bolt
- ✅ Predictive scheduling for zero-latency
- ✅ Full IPC daemon architecture
