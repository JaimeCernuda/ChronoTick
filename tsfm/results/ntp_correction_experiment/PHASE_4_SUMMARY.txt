PHASE 4: 8-HOUR EVALUATION SUMMARY
================================================================

CRITICAL FINDING: NTP CORRECTION IS BROKEN
The ADVANCED NTP correction mechanism introduces drift over time
instead of correcting it. ChronoTick performs worse than the
system clock after hour 2.


THREE-WAY COMPARISON
================================================================

1. SHORT-ONLY (8-hour)
   MAE: 21,417 ms (21.4 seconds)
   Result: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE ❌
   Problem: 5-second horizon insufficient for long-term stability

2. DUAL-MODEL + NTP ADVANCED (8-hour) [CURRENT TEST]
   MAE: 129.99 ms
   Result: WORSE THAN SYSTEM CLOCK ⚠️
   Problem: NTP correction introduces drift (0.654 correlation)

   Performance by quartile:
   - Q1 (0-2h):  45.08ms - 41% BETTER than system ✅
   - Q2 (2-4h): 137.49ms - 54% WORSE than system ❌
   - Q3 (4-6h): 160.00ms - 141% WORSE than system ❌
   - Q4 (6-8h): 178.12ms - 68% WORSE than system ❌

3. System Clock (Baseline)
   MAE: 84.89 ms
   Result: Stable throughout 8 hours ✅
   Note: No ML, just raw system clock


KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================

✅ DUAL-MODEL architecture works (165x better than SHORT-ONLY)
❌ NTP ADVANCED correction is counterproductive after 2 hours
⚠️  Need to test DUAL-MODEL WITHOUT NTP correction at 8-hour scale


MISSING DATA
================================================================

User mentioned: "the other long term run we have made that used
short + long but no ntp correction mechanism"

This test is CRITICAL but appears to not exist yet at 8-hour scale.
Previous tests were only 25 minutes, which showed different behavior.


RECOMMENDATION
================================================================

1. Run DUAL-MODEL WITHOUT NTP correction for 8 hours
   Expected: Stable 60-100ms throughout

2. If stable: Use it for production
   If not: Investigate ML model architecture

3. Abandon NTP ADVANCED correction mechanism
   - Helps initially (<2h)
   - Degrades long-term (>2h)
   - Worse than no correction
