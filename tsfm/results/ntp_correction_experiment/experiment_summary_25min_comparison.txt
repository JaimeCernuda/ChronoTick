   3. LINEAR:      11.455ms avg delta


KEY FINDINGS
================================================================

1. DRIFT_AWARE is the clear winner:
   - Best accuracy (9.519ms MAE)
   - Most consistent (4.711ms StdDev)
   - Lowest peak errors (17.611ms max)
   - Smallest corrections needed (3.839ms avg)
   - Most evaluation samples (18)

2. LINEAR is a strong second place:
   - Only 0.861ms worse than DRIFT_AWARE for MAE
   - Simpler implementation
   - 81% improvement over baseline

3. ADVANCED underperformed:
   - 2.7x worse MAE than DRIFT_AWARE
   - Only 8 evaluation samples (vs 18 for DRIFT_AWARE)
   - May be overfitting or using incorrect assumptions
   - Despite similar correction counts, results are worse

4. Correction efficiency matters:
   - DRIFT_AWARE makes smaller, more precise corrections
   - LINEAR makes larger corrections but still effective
   - Smaller corrections = less disruption to ML model training


RECOMMENDATION
================================================================

Deploy DRIFT_AWARE as the default NTP correction method:

✓ Best accuracy across all metrics
✓ Most consistent performance (lowest variance)
✓ Smallest corrections needed (gentle on dataset)
✓ Robust with 18 successful evaluations

Configuration setting:
