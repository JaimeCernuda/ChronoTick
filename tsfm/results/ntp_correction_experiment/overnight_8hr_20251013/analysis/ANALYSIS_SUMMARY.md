### Backtracking Corrections

**From Log Analysis** (10-minute validation test):
- First correction: 6 seconds after warmup (0 predictions replaced - scheduler just started)
- Second correction: 18 predictions replaced (2.52-41.19ms range, error: 42.50ms over 183s)
- Third correction: 18 predictions replaced (17.38-66.99ms range, error: 44.51ms over 183s)

**Pattern**: Backtracking corrections triggered every ~180 seconds (3 minutes) as configured, consistently replacing 15-20 predictions per event with NTP-interpolated ground truth values.
