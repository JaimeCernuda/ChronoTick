# Overnight Test Launch Summary

## Test Successfully Launched

**Launch Time**: 2025-10-13 00:51:12 UTC
**Bash ID**: 587d26
**Status**: Running
**Expected Completion**: 2025-10-13 08:51:12 UTC (8 hours)

## Validated Behavior (First 2 Minutes)

### Warmup Phase (00:51:16 - 00:52:16) ✓
- Duration: 60 seconds as configured
- NTP measurements collected: 10 at 5-second intervals
- Advanced NTP mode: 2-3 samples per server, ~20-27ms uncertainty
- Winner: time.google.com consistently (lowest uncertainty)
- No predictions made during warmup (correct behavior)
- No backtracking corrections during warmup (correct behavior with warmup fix)

### Operational Phase Started (00:52:16) ✓
- Dataset populated with 10 NTP measurements
- Scheduler activated successfully
- TimesFM 2.5 model loaded (200M params, 2048 context)
- CPU predictions started (5-second interval, 30-step horizon)
- First prediction batch: 30 predictions cached (42.60ms → 1.19ms offsets)

### First Backtracking Correction (00:52:23) ✓
- Triggered 6 seconds after warmup (at first operational NTP)
- Error calculated: -0.37ms over 6 seconds
- Strategy: REPLACE predictions with interpolated NTP
- NTP boundaries: 42.14ms @ t=1760334732 → 41.77ms @ t=1760334738
- Predictions replaced: 0 (scheduler just started, no predictions in that interval yet)
- Dataset corrections: 6 measurements adjusted

### NTP Quality ✓
Sample from logs:
```
time.google.com: offset=41.48ms, delay=39.9ms, uncertainty=19.97ms (stratum 1)
time.google.com: offset=40.13ms, delay=47.1ms, uncertainty=23.54ms (stratum 1)
time.google.com: offset=41.18ms, delay=43.0ms, uncertainty=21.49ms (stratum 1)
time.google.com: offset=41.98ms, delay=45.1ms, uncertainty=22.54ms (stratum 1)
time.google.com: offset=40.96ms, delay=46.8ms, uncertainty=23.40ms (stratum 1)
```
**Observed Uncertainty**: 19-24ms (excellent, matches 15-40ms target)

### Model Predictions ✓
CPU model generating predictions successfully:
- Context: 10-12 measurements (padded to 128 for TimesFM)
- Horizon: 30 steps (5-30 seconds ahead)
- Prediction range: 0.74ms - 42.60ms (reasonable offset evolution)
- Cache populated: 30+ predictions every 5 seconds
- Inference time: ~700-800ms per batch (reasonable for CPU)

### Long-Term Model Status ✓
- Initially skipped (insufficient data, expected)
- Will activate once dataset grows (need ~300 measurements for 60-step horizon)
- Expected to start contributing predictions after ~5-10 minutes

### Quantiles Status ✓
- TimesFM 2.5 quantiles extracted automatically (not shown in INFO logs)
- Propagated through PredictionWithUncertainty → CorrectionWithBounds
- Available for MCP confidence interval tool
- Will be validated in post-test analysis

## Expected Timeline

| Time | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 00:51:16 | Warmup start | Collect 10 NTP measurements @ 5s intervals |
| 00:52:16 | Operational mode | Scheduler starts, NTP switches to 180s intervals |
| 00:55:16 | First operational NTP | Backtracking correction #1 (~15-20 predictions replaced) |
| 00:58:16 | Second operational NTP | Backtracking correction #2 |
| 01:01:16 | Third operational NTP | Backtracking correction #3 |
| ... | Every 3 minutes | Backtracking corrections continue |
| 08:51:12 | Test complete | ~160 NTP measurements, ~160 backtracking events |

## Output Files Being Generated

Live output files in `visualization_data/`:
1. `summary_backtracking_20251013_005116.csv` - Correction event summaries
2. `client_predictions_backtracking_20251013_005116.csv` - All client predictions
3. `dataset_corrections_backtracking_20251013_005116.csv` - Dataset correction log

## Transient Issues (Resolved)

**Cache Miss at Startup** (00:52:17):
- One cache miss immediately after warmup→operational transition
- Root cause: Client request arrived before first prediction batch completed
- Impact: Minimal - logged error but system recovered in <1 second
- Resolution: Next prediction batch cached successfully
- Status: Not a concern, expected during rapid startup

## Next Steps (Morning Analysis)

When test completes (~08:51:12):
1. Verify exit code 0 (success)
2. Count total NTP measurements (expect ~160)
3. Count total backtracking corrections (expect ~160)
4. Analyze NTP uncertainty distribution (target 15-40ms)
5. Calculate mean prediction error from corrections
6. Visualize error evolution over 8 hours
7. Validate quantile coverage (90% CI accuracy)
8. Generate performance summary report
9. Compare short-term vs long-term model contributions
