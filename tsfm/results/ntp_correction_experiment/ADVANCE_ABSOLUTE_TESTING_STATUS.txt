ADVANCE_ABSOLUTE TESTING - Phase 2 Supplemental Test
================================================================

Started: 2025-10-12 00:07 UTC
Expected Completion: 2025-10-12 00:32 UTC (~25 minutes)
Process ID: 1521171

Configuration:
  - Model: SHORT-TERM ONLY (config_short_only.yaml)
  - Method: advance_absolute
  - Duration: 25 minutes (1500 seconds)
  - Interval: 10 seconds
  - Covariates: DISABLED

Output Directory:
  results/ntp_correction_experiment/phase2_short_only/advance_absolute/

Log File:

WHY TEST ADVANCE_ABSOLUTE?
================================================================

Phase 1 (DUAL-MODEL) Results:
  - ADVANCE_ABSOLUTE: 70.455ms MAE ❌ (worst performer)
  - Performed WORSE than baseline NONE (54.886ms)
  - Considered failed in Phase 1

However, Phase 2 revealed a major finding:
  - SHORT-ONLY improved ADVANCED from 25.857ms → 4.903ms (81% better!)
  - Pattern: Dual-model fusion was HURTING performance

Question: Will advance_absolute also benefit from SHORT-ONLY?

Hypothesis: The advance_absolute algorithm may have been degraded by
dual-model fusion. Testing with SHORT-ONLY will reveal if the algorithm
itself is flawed or if it was just incompatible with fusion.


CURRENT PHASE 2 RESULTS (SHORT-ONLY)
================================================================

Completed Tests:
  1. ADVANCED:     4.903ms ⭐ BEST
  2. NONE:         5.980ms
  3. DRIFT_AWARE:  9.974ms
  4. LINEAR:      34.034ms

Running Now:
  5. ADVANCE_ABSOLUTE: In progress...


WHAT'S NEXT?
================================================================

After advance_absolute completes (~25 minutes):

1. Calculate MAE vs NTP ground truth
2. Update PHASE_1_VS_PHASE_2_COMPARISON.txt
3. Determine final winner between:
   - ADVANCED (4.903ms)
   - ADVANCE_ABSOLUTE (TBD)

If advance_absolute performs well:
  - May become the new winner
  - Would validate hypothesis about fusion degradation

If advance_absolute still performs poorly:
  - ADVANCED remains winner
  - Confirms the algorithm itself has issues


FUTURE TEST PHASES
================================================================

Phase 3: Covariates Testing
  - Test winner WITH and WITHOUT covariates
  - Variables: cpu_usage, temperature, memory_usage
  - Determine if external factors improve accuracy

Phase 4: 8-Hour Overnight Validation
  - Extended stability test
  - Production readiness validation
  - Final configuration confirmation


MONITORING THE TEST
