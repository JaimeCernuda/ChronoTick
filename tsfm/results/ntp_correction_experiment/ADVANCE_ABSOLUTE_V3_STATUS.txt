ADVANCE_ABSOLUTE v3 - Implementation Status
================================================

IMPLEMENTATION: ✓ COMPLETE AND WORKING

Algorithm:
- Uses uncertainty-weighted distribution (same as 'advanced')
- Distributes TOTAL accumulated error = E × N/2 (not just point error E)
- Directional correction automatic via error sign

Current Test Status:
- 5-minute test running (started ~20:32)
- Logs confirm correct implementation
- Directional correction working:
  * error > 0 → PUSH UP (under-predicted)
  * error < 0 → PUSH DOWN (over-predicted)


OBSERVED BEHAVIOR (Warmup Phase)
==================================

During Warmup (first 180 seconds):
  - NTP corrections every 5-6 seconds (very frequent)
  - Only 1 timestamp per interval
  - Amplification: 0.5x (LESS than point error)
  - Example: error = -7.85ms → correction = -3.93ms

Why 0.5x amplification?
  - num_timestamps = 1
  - total_accumulated_error = E × 1/2 = 0.5 × E
  - Defeats the purpose of "accumulated error" approach

This is EXPECTED during warmup - algorithm is correct.


EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (Steady State)
==================================

After Warmup (180s+):
  - NTP corrections every ~180 seconds (less frequent)
  - ~180 timestamps per interval
  - Amplification: 90x (MUCH MORE than point error!)
  - Example: error = -7.85ms → correction = -353.25ms total distributed

Calculation:
  - num_timestamps ≈ 180
  - total_accumulated_error = E × 180/2 = 90 × E
  - Corrections will be VERY aggressive

This is where we'll see if the "accumulated error" approach helps or hurts!


COMPARISON TO OTHER METHODS
=============================

NONE (baseline):
  - No corrections
  - MAE: 54.886ms

LINEAR:
  - Linear distribution of point error E
  - sum(corrections) = E
  - MAE: 10.380ms

DRIFT_AWARE ⭐ Current Winner:
  - Attributes E to offset + drift
  - sum(corrections) = E
  - MAE: 9.519ms

ADVANCED:
  - Uncertainty-weighted distribution of E
  - sum(corrections) = E
  - MAE: 25.857ms

ADVANCE_ABSOLUTE v1:
  - FAILED - dimensional error
  - MAE: 70.455ms (worse than baseline!)

ADVANCE_ABSOLUTE v3:
  - Uncertainty-weighted distribution of E × N/2
  - sum(corrections) = E × N/2 (90x for 180s intervals!)
  - MAE: ??? (to be determined)


KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
=========================

1. Does accounting for cumulative drift improve accuracy?
   - Hypothesis: Correcting for total accumulated error should better align with NTP

2. Or does it over-correct and introduce new errors?
   - Risk: 90x amplification might be too aggressive

3. How does performance compare during warmup vs steady state?
   - Warmup: 0.5x (less aggressive)
   - Steady: 90x (very aggressive)

4. Is there an optimal amplification factor?
   - Perhaps between 1x (current methods) and 90x (full accumulated)


NEXT STEPS
===========

1. Wait for 5-minute test to complete
2. Check logs for steady-state intervals (after 180s warmup)
3. Look for amplification factors approaching 90x
4. Run visualization to see correction effects
5. If results look reasonable, run full 25-minute test
6. Compare MAE vs other methods


POTENTIAL ISSUES
================

Issue: Very aggressive corrections (90x) might destabilize predictions
Solution: Could introduce damping factor or cap amplification

Issue: Assumes linear drift, but actual drift may be non-linear
Solution: Algorithm still distributes total error proportionally

Issue: Short intervals during warmup don't benefit from approach
Solution: This is fine - algorithm adapts based on interval length


DIRECTIONAL CORRECTION EXAMPLES
=================================

Over-predicted (error < 0):
  - Point error: -7.85ms
  - Total accumulated: -353.25ms (for 180s interval)
  - Effect: ALL corrections are NEGATIVE → push predictions DOWN
  - Aligns predictions closer to lower NTP value

Under-predicted (error > 0):
  - Point error: +11.15ms
  - Total accumulated: +501.75ms (for 180s interval)
  - Effect: ALL corrections are POSITIVE → push predictions UP
  - Aligns predictions closer to higher NTP value
