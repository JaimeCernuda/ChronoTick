# ChronoTick Evaluation Plan

## Overview
Three comprehensive evaluations to validate ChronoTick's predictive time synchronization system, progressing from basic correctness validation to distributed systems performance to multi-agent AI coordination scenarios.

## Available Resources
- **Local Machine**: AMD GPU for model inference and development
- **ARES HPC Cluster**: Large-scale CPU cluster with PFS, no GPU
- **Chameleon Cloud**: Limited GPU nodes for AI agent workloads
- **Existing Datasets**: synced_tacc.csv, unsynced.csv, unsynced_uc.csv from https://github.com/JaimeCernuda/LLMs/tree/main/datasets

## Evaluation 1: Correctness & Accuracy with Real-World Datasets

### Objective
Validate ChronoTick's predictive synchronization accuracy against ground truth timing data and compare with baseline approaches (NTP, reactive synchronization).

### Experimental Design

#### 1. Dataset Collection & Enhancement
- Use existing datasets (synced_tacc.csv, unsynced.csv, unsynced_uc.csv) as baseline
- Collect new 7-day continuous traces from:
  - Your local AMD GPU machine (thermal drift patterns)
  - ARES HPC cluster nodes (network jitter, load variations)
  - Cloud VMs with different virtualization layers

#### 2. Metrics to Measure
- **Prediction accuracy**: MAE, RMSE of offset predictions vs ground truth
- **Uncertainty calibration**: Whether 95% CI contains true values 95% of the time
- **Drift pattern recognition**: Ability to detect diurnal, load-based patterns
- **Convergence speed**: Time to achieve <10μs accuracy after warmup

#### 3. Experimental Protocol
```python
# Replay historical data through ChronoTick
# Compare predictions with known ground truth
# Test different foundation models (Chronos-Bolt, TimesFM, TTM)
# Evaluate with/without covariates (temperature, CPU load)
```

#### 4. Resource Requirements
- Local AMD GPU machine for model inference
- Historical datasets with ground truth synchronization

### Expected Outcomes
- Demonstrate 86% uncertainty reduction vs NTP (as claimed)
- Show <10μs accuracy after 180s warmup
- Identify which models perform best for different drift patterns

## Evaluation 2: Distributed Clock Synchronization (Without Agents)

### Objective
Evaluate ChronoTick's performance in traditional distributed systems scenarios without AI agents, focusing on scalability and network effects.

### Experimental Design

#### 1. Deployment Architecture
- Deploy ChronoTick on 10-50 ARES HPC nodes
- Create hierarchical synchronization topology:
  - **Tier 1**: 1-2 reference nodes with PTP/GPS simulation
  - **Tier 2**: 5-10 intermediate nodes
  - **Tier 3**: Remaining edge nodes

#### 2. Workload Scenarios

**Scenario A: Distributed Database Consistency**
- Simulate distributed transactions requiring timestamp ordering
- Measure causal consistency violations

**Scenario B: Log Aggregation**
- Generate timestamped events across nodes
- Measure temporal ordering accuracy in merged logs

**Scenario C: Network Partition Resilience**
- Introduce network delays/partitions
- Measure drift during isolation and reconvergence time

#### 3. Metrics
- Inter-node synchronization accuracy (μs)
- Message overhead vs NTP
- Scalability: Performance with increasing node count
- Network resilience: Accuracy under 10-100ms RTT variations

#### 4. Implementation on ARES
```bash
# Use SLURM to allocate nodes
# Deploy ChronoTick via containers or modules
# Use MPI for inter-node communication testing
# Leverage PFS for shared timing logs
```

### Expected Outcomes
- Demonstrate microsecond-level synchronization across 50+ nodes
- Show resilience to network variations common in HPC environments
- Quantify overhead vs traditional NTP deployment

## Evaluation 3: Multi-Agent AI Coordination

### Objective
Validate ChronoTick's effectiveness for distributed AI agent coordination with MCP integration.

### Experimental Design

#### 1. Agent Deployment Scenarios

**Scenario A: Collaborative Training**
- Deploy federated learning agents on Chameleon Cloud GPU nodes
- Agents exchange gradients requiring precise temporal ordering
- Measure convergence speed improvement with ChronoTick

**Scenario B: Multi-Agent Auction System**
- Implement high-frequency trading simulation
- Agents submit bids with microsecond-critical timestamps
- Measure fairness violations and arbitrage opportunities

**Scenario C: Swarm Coordination**
- Simulate drone/robot swarm requiring synchronized actions
- Test formation changes, collaborative sensing
- Measure coordination failures due to timing errors

#### 2. Technical Implementation
```python
# Each agent connects via MCP to local ChronoTick
# Agents use get_time() for timestamping decisions
# Use get_time_with_future_uncertainty() for planning
```

#### 3. Comparison Baselines
- Agents using system clock only
- Agents with NTP synchronization
- Agents with logical clocks (Lamport timestamps)

#### 4. Metrics
- Decision synchronization accuracy (% coordinated actions)
- Causal consistency violations in agent protocols
- Performance impact: Agent decision latency with ChronoTick
- Scalability: Performance with 10, 50, 100+ agents

#### 5. Resource Allocation
- **Chameleon Cloud**: 3-5 GPU nodes for agent compute
- **ARES**: Additional CPU nodes for non-GPU agents
- **Local machine**: Development and small-scale testing

### Expected Outcomes
- Show >90% reduction in coordination failures vs NTP
- Demonstrate sub-millisecond agent decision synchronization
- Validate MCP interface performance (<1ms response time)

## Implementation Timeline & Resource Strategy
