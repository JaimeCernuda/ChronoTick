# Fastest Python IPC Methods for Sharing Floating Point Numbers

Python's shared memory approaches can achieve **sub-2 microsecond latency** for sharing floats between processes on Linux, approaching C performance with proper optimization. The fastest method for a single float is `multiprocessing.RawValue` with ctypes (100-300 nanoseconds), while larger datasets benefit from SharedMemory with NumPy arrays (100x faster than serialization). However, achieving optimal performance requires careful attention to synchronization patterns, memory alignment, and CPU pinning.

## Understanding the performance landscape

Python IPC performance spans three orders of magnitude depending on the approach. At the low end, **shared memory methods achieve 1-2 microsecond latency**, competitive with C implementations that benchmark at 1.4 microseconds for similar operations. In contrast, serialization-based methods like multiprocessing.Queue add 100-1000 microseconds of overhead due to pickle/unpickle costs. For large NumPy arrays, this gap widens dramatically—SharedMemory completed a 240MB array transfer in 2.09 seconds versus 216 seconds for copying, a **103x performance improvement**. The choice of IPC mechanism fundamentally determines whether your application operates at memory bandwidth speeds or serialization bottleneck speeds.

The Global Interpreter Lock indirectly impacts IPC by forcing CPU-bound parallel tasks to use multiprocessing instead of threading. While the GIL doesn't directly slow IPC operations (each process has its own interpreter), it adds unavoidable process creation overhead (100-1000ms per process) and necessitates explicit data sharing mechanisms. Python 3.13's experimental GIL-free mode shows threading can match multiprocessing performance while eliminating IPC overhead entirely, but this remains experimental as of 2025.

## Core Python IPC mechanisms compared

**multiprocessing.shared_memory** (Python 3.8+) provides the most modern and flexible approach. It uses POSIX `shm_open()` on Linux to create shared memory objects backed by tmpfs at `/dev/shm`, enabling zero-copy data sharing between processes. Creating a shared memory block for a single float requires just 4 bytes with minimal overhead—creation takes 1-5 microseconds, while reads and writes operate at native memory speeds of ~100 nanoseconds. The API is straightforward: create with a name, attach in other processes using that name, and access the raw buffer directly.

For single floats specifically, you write with `struct.pack_into('f', shm.buf, 0, 3.14159)` and read with `struct.unpack_from('f', shm.buf, 0)[0]`. The module integrates seamlessly with NumPy by passing `buffer=shm.buf` when creating arrays. The main drawback is manual synchronization—you must implement your own locking using multiprocessing.Lock or atomic operations. Resource cleanup requires calling both `close()` and `unlink()`, though SharedMemoryManager handles this automatically in context managers.

**multiprocessing.Value and Array** predate shared_memory but remain useful for simpler use cases. Under the hood, they use anonymous shared memory via `mmap()` with `MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_SHARED` on Linux. Creating a shared float is simple: `Value('f', 3.14159)` creates a 4-byte c_float with an integrated RLock for thread and process safety. Access is clean—`val.value` for reads and writes—but this convenience costs 1-2 microseconds per access due to lock acquisition overhead. The synchronized wrapper adds roughly 90 bytes of memory overhead versus 4 bytes for the raw float.

For high-performance scenarios, `RawValue('f', 0.0)` eliminates the lock entirely, reducing access time to 100-300 nanoseconds matching bare shared memory. This works well for single-writer-single-reader patterns where explicit synchronization isn't needed. The key advantage over SharedMemory is automatic cleanup and inheritance—child processes created via fork automatically have access without needing to pass names. However, you cannot share Values between unrelated processes, and the lock becomes a bottleneck with multiple writers.

**mmap module** offers maximum control at the cost of complexity. On Linux it provides direct access to the `mmap()` system call with full control over flags (`MAP_SHARED`, `MAP_ANONYMOUS`, `MAP_PRIVATE`) and protection bits. For anonymous shared memory, you create with `mmap.mmap(-1, 4, mmap.MAP_SHARED, mmap.PROT_READ | mmap.PROT_WRITE)`, then read/write using struct packing or slice notation. Performance matches SharedMemory at 100-300 nanoseconds for mapped memory access after the initial 1-5 microsecond mmap call.

The primary use cases for mmap are file-backed persistence and legacy Python versions before 3.8. For file-backed sharing, create a file in `/dev/shm` (tmpfs on Linux) for memory-backed performance equivalent to anonymous memory. The downside is no built-in synchronization and platform differences—Windows uses tagnames for named mappings while Linux requires file-based or POSIX shared memory. Manual lifecycle management increases error-proneness compared to the higher-level APIs.

**NumPy shared memory arrays** combine NumPy's performance with shared memory efficiency. You can wrap SharedMemory buffers: `arr = np.ndarray((1,), dtype=np.float32, buffer=shm.buf)` creates a zero-copy NumPy view of shared memory. Alternatively, use `RawArray('f', 1)` then `np.frombuffer(shared_mem, dtype=np.float32)` for backward compatibility with Python 3.7. Memory-mapped files work via `np.memmap('/tmp/shared.dat', dtype=np.float32, mode='r+', shape=(1,))`.

For read-only scenarios on Linux, fork's copy-on-write behavior enables zero-overhead sharing—children inherit parent memory pages without copying until writes occur. This achieved 80ms for processing a 1.5GB array versus 100ms for read-write SharedMemory. The catch is it only works with fork start method and data becomes private if modified. NumPy operations on shared arrays perform at hardware speeds (~50-200 nanoseconds per element) but require in-place modifications (`arr[:] += 1`) to avoid creating copies.

## Benchmark results quantified

C-based IPC benchmarks using the goldsborough/ipc-bench repository on Linux establish baseline performance: **shared memory achieves 1.4 microsecond average latency** with 4.7 million messages per second for 100-byte messages. This drops to 1.66 million messages per second at 1KB due to bandwidth constraints. In comparison, pipes manage only 162,000 msg/s, FIFOs reach 266,000 msg/s, and TCP sockets fall to 70,000 msg/s—making shared memory **20-200x faster** than traditional IPC mechanisms.

Python-specific measurements show optimized implementations can approach C performance. On an i9-9900k at 5GHz with a Preempt-RT kernel and isolated CPU cores, Python pipe IPC achieved **1.75 microsecond mean latency** (minimum 1.60 µs, 99th percentile 1.82 µs). Sockets were slightly slower at 2.15 microsecond mean. Standard configurations without optimization typically see 100-1000 microseconds for pipes and queues, showing the dramatic impact of system tuning.

For NumPy arrays, comprehensive benchmarks on a 1.5GB float64 array demonstrate the massive advantage of shared memory approaches. Using pickle serialization required 4,138 milliseconds—a catastrophically slow baseline. In contrast, SharedMemory completed in 100ms, RawArray in 102ms, and tmpfs-backed mmap in 109ms. **Shared memory was 58x faster** than pickle. Copy-on-write via fork achieved the fastest time at 80ms but only works read-only. Disk-backed mmap took 160ms, showing that tmpfs (RAM-backed) is **1.5x faster** than actual disk storage.

The multiprocessing.Queue vs Pipe comparison reveals significant performance differences. Queue achieved 234 MB/s throughput versus Pipe's 58 MB/s on Windows, making Queue **4x faster** in this configuration. Some users reported Queue being up to 500x faster in edge cases, though typical differences are more modest. Manager-based queues were disastrously slow at 2.8 MB/s due to additional proxy overhead.

Python versus C performance varies dramatically by context. For CPU-bound loops, C can be 1,800x faster (45 seconds versus 0.025 seconds for 30 million iterations). However, for IPC specifically, Python's overhead is much smaller when avoiding serialization—shared memory IPC adds roughly 10-50x overhead for small messages compared to C, but this gap nearly disappears for large datasets where memory bandwidth dominates.

## Lock-free techniques and atomic operations

Python lacks native atomic operations, but the **atomics library** (github.com/doodspav/atomics) provides hardware-level atomics by wrapping the patomic C library. It supports both thread-safe and process-safe operations on shared memory buffers with memory ordering semantics (SEQ_CST, ACQUIRE, RELEASE, RELAXED). The API includes atomic increment, decrement, add, exchange, and compare-and-swap operations critical for lock-free algorithms.

For process-safe usage, create atomic views of SharedMemory buffers. The pattern is: create SharedMemory, get buffer, wrap with `atomics.atomicview(buffer=buf, atype=atomics.INT)`, then perform operations like `a.load()`, `a.store(value)`, `a.inc()`, and `a.cmpxchg_strong(expected, desired)`. This enables lock-free single-writer-single-reader (SWSR) patterns where producer and consumer don't block each other. Real-world implementations achieve **2.6 million messages per second** between C and Python using atomic operations on shared ring buffers—100x faster than remote interfaces like Redis.

Single-writer-single-reader ring buffers provide the simplest lock-free pattern. The structure uses atomic write and read indices pointing into a circular buffer. The producer writes to `buffer[write_index % buffer_size]`, then atomically increments write_index. The consumer checks if `read_index < write_index` (data available), reads from `buffer[read_index % buffer_size]`, and increments read_index. Because only one writer and one reader exist, no coordination is needed beyond atomic index updates. This pattern achieves minimal latency limited only by memory bandwidth, not synchronization overhead.

Memory alignment becomes critical for atomic operations. Modern x86/x64 processors require naturally aligned access for atomicity—4-byte values must be 4-byte aligned, 8-byte values 8-byte aligned. Cache lines are 64 bytes, and accessing variables on the same cache line from different cores causes **false sharing**, degrading performance by 5-8x due to cache coherency protocol overhead. The solution is padding structures to separate frequently-modified variables by at least 64 bytes. Python's atomics library handles alignment automatically, but when using ctypes manually, verify alignment with `assert ctypes.addressof(obj) % 8 == 0`.

Standard Python ctypes does not provide atomic operations—Python bug tracker issue #31654 requested this feature but it remains unimplemented. For direct memory access without atomics, use ctypes structures mapping to shared memory: `SharedData.from_buffer(shm.buf)` creates a C structure view of SharedMemory. This allows efficient access but without atomicity guarantees. For atomic access patterns, the atomics library is currently the only pure-Python solution that works across processes.

## CPU pinning and process priorities for deterministic latency

CPU affinity controls which cores a process can run on, reducing cache misses and migration overhead. On Linux, `os.sched_setaffinity(0, {0, 1})` pins the calling process to cores 0 and 1. The cross-platform alternative using psutil is `psutil.Process().cpu_affinity([0, 1])`. For producer-consumer IPC, pin each to separate cores on the same NUMA node—for example, producer on core 0, consumer on core 1. This keeps processes close for shared memory access while preventing cache contention.

The benefits are most pronounced under load. On an idle system with many available cores, pinning can actually hurt by restricting options. On a loaded system, pinning eliminates unpredictable scheduling delays and keeps L1/L2 caches warm for the process's working set. For NUMA systems (typical in servers with multiple CPU sockets), keeping processes on the same NUMA node as their memory avoids cross-socket memory access that adds 100+ nanoseconds latency. Check NUMA topology with `numactl --hardware` and pin accordingly.

Process priorities influence CPU scheduler decisions. Nice values range from -20 (highest priority) to +19 (lowest), with 0 as default. Setting nice values is platform-specific: `os.nice(-5)` on Linux requires root privileges and reduces the nice value (increasing priority), while `psutil.Process().nice(-5)` works cross-platform. For latency-critical IPC, use nice values between -5 and -10. Avoid exceeding -15 unless absolutely necessary, as this can starve other processes.

Real-time priorities (SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR) provide the most deterministic scheduling but require root and careful testing. SCHED_FIFO processes run until they block or yield, with priority 1-99 (99 highest). Setting priority 99 can hang your system if the process enters an infinite loop. Start with priorities around 50-70 for testing. Use `chrt -f -p 50 <pid>` to set SCHED_FIFO, or via ctypes calling `sched_setscheduler()`. Real-time priorities are essential for hard real-time systems but overkill for most applications—nice values and CPU pinning suffice for microsecond-scale latency requirements.

## Bypassing Python object overhead for maximum speed

Every Python object carries significant overhead—even a simple float is a PyObject with reference count, type pointer, and value, totaling ~28 bytes versus 4 bytes for a C float. Multiprocessing by default pickles objects for transfer, adding hundreds of microseconds to milliseconds depending on complexity. To achieve minimal latency, avoid Python objects in the IPC path entirely.

The solution is working directly with raw memory via struct packing. For a single float in SharedMemory: `struct.pack_into('f', shm.buf, 0, value)` writes raw bytes and `struct.unpack_from('f', shm.buf, 0)[0]` reads them. This adds only 100-200 nanoseconds overhead beyond raw memory access. For arrays, NumPy provides zero-copy views: `np.ndarray((size,), dtype=np.float32, buffer=shm.buf)` wraps the shared memory without copying. NumPy operations compile to C code and use SIMD instructions, operating at 50-200 nanoseconds per element.

Critical performance trap: NumPy operations can create copies if not in-place. The expression `arr = arr + 1` allocates a new array, breaks the shared memory connection, and wastes time. Instead use `arr[:] += 1` or `arr += 1` for in-place modification that operates directly on shared memory. Similarly, `arr.copy()` is necessary when you need a separate copy but should be avoided in hot paths where reading shared memory directly suffices.

For maximum performance critical paths, C extensions eliminate Python overhead entirely. A simple C function accepting a memoryview can write floats with zero Python object overhead: `*(double*)buffer.buf = value`. Combined with shared memory and atomic operations, this approaches bare metal performance. The trade-off is development complexity—C extensions require compilation, type safety management, and memory management. Most applications achieve sufficient performance with the atomics library and NumPy without resorting to custom C code.

## Implementation patterns for robust production systems

Error handling distinguishes proof-of-concept code from production systems. SharedMemory raises FileExistsError if attempting to create with a name that already exists, and FileNotFoundError when attaching to nonexistent memory. Robust code uses try-except blocks with retry logic for attachment (the producer may not have created the memory yet) and handles cleanup in finally blocks or atexit handlers. Resource tracker warnings are common in Python 3.8-3.10 (fixed in 3.11+) when using spawn start method—setting `track=False` and managing cleanup manually avoids these issues.

Context managers ensure cleanup happens even on exceptions. A production-ready wrapper class should implement `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods that handle both `close()` and `unlink()` operations, catching FileNotFoundError during unlink (someone else already cleaned up) and logging warnings rather than failing. For unrelated processes not sharing a resource tracker, you must manually unregister with `multiprocessing.resource_tracker.unregister(shm.name, 'shared_memory')` before cleanup to avoid resource tracker errors.

Synchronization patterns depend on access patterns. Single-writer-single-reader needs no locks if using atomic indices—the producer writes then increments write_index atomically, consumer reads then increments read_index. Single-writer-multiple-reader requires atomic write_index but each reader can maintain its own read_index independently. Multiple-writer scenarios require either multiprocessing.Lock around write operations (1-2 microsecond overhead per access) or lock-free algorithms using compare-and-swap operations from the atomics library (more complex but faster under contention).

Testing multiprocessing code requires careful setup. Use unittest with subprocess-based workers that communicate results back via Queue. Clean up shared memory before each test using `subprocess.run(['rm', '-rf', '/dev/shm/psm_*'])` on Linux to ensure a fresh slate. Enable detailed logging with `multiprocessing.log_to_stderr().setLevel(multiprocessing.SUBDEBUG)` to debug resource tracker issues. For simpler debugging, consider using threading.Thread instead of multiprocessing.Process during development (easier to step through with pdb) then switch to Process for production.

## Third-party libraries that simplify high-performance IPC

The **faster-fifo library** (github.com/alex-petrenko/faster-fifo) provides a drop-in replacement for multiprocessing.Queue with dramatically better performance—up to **30x faster** in benchmarks. It implements a circular buffer with POSIX mutexes and supports batch operations via `get_many()` and `put_many()` that reduce overhead for high-throughput scenarios. Installation is simple (`pip install faster-fifo`) and API compatibility means you can replace `from multiprocessing import Queue` with `from faster_fifo import Queue` with minimal code changes. Benchmarks show 2.6 million messages/second achievable versus ~100K msg/s for standard Queue.

**posix_ipc** (github.com/osvenskan/posix_ipc) provides production-hardened POSIX IPC primitives: named shared memory, semaphores, and message queues. Its advantage is cross-language compatibility—you can share memory between Python, C, C++, and other languages using standardized POSIX interfaces. The library has been stable for 7+ years with minimal bugs and works on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and Cygwin (not Windows). For semaphores specifically, it provides faster synchronization than multiprocessing.Lock for signaling patterns, though multiprocessing.Lock suffices for most use cases.

**SharedArray** offers a simpler NumPy-focused API: `sa.create("shm://array_name", size, dtype=float)` creates named arrays accessible across processes, and `sa.attach("shm://array_name")` connects to them. The library handles POSIX shared memory lifecycle automatically. However, it's Linux-specific (no Windows), limited to ~20% of total memory by default (configurable via `/dev/shm` mount options), and less actively maintained than alternatives. For new projects, multiprocessing.SharedMemory provides similar functionality with better platform support.

**atomics library** deserves special mention for enabling lock-free algorithms in Python. While not strictly an IPC library, it's essential for achieving minimal-latency communication by eliminating lock overhead. It works on CPython 3.6+ and PyPy, providing hardware-backed atomic operations with memory ordering guarantees. The performance benefit is substantial—lock-free ring buffers using atomics achieve 5-10x higher throughput than locked implementations under contention.

## Realistic expectations for Python versus C performance

For minimal latency float sharing, Python can achieve **1.75-2 microsecond latency** on optimized systems using shared memory and CPU pinning, compared to 1.4 microseconds for equivalent C code. This 25-40% overhead is remarkably small given Python's interpreted nature. The key is staying in C code paths—NumPy operations, struct packing, and atomic library calls all execute compiled C, with Python merely coordinating the workflow.

The GIL adds unavoidable process creation overhead (100-1000ms per spawn) that threading avoids, but this is a one-time cost amortized over the process lifetime. For long-running producer-consumer processes communicating millions of times per second, the creation cost is negligible. The experimental GIL-free Python 3.13t shows threading matching multiprocessing performance (0.49s vs 0.51s on 8-core CPU-bound task), suggesting future Python may eliminate the multiprocessing requirement entirely.

Where Python shows its biggest disadvantage is CPU-bound processing between IPC operations. If you're doing heavy numerical computation on each float received, Python is 40-1800x slower than C depending on optimization level. The solution is using NumPy for vectorized operations (approaching C speed) or Cython to compile performance-critical functions. For pure IPC latency, Python's overhead is minimal; for processing throughput, the choice of algorithms and libraries matters more than the IPC mechanism.

Memory bandwidth becomes the limiting factor for large data transfers. Once you eliminate serialization overhead by using shared memory, transferring a 1.5GB array takes ~100ms regardless of whether you use SharedMemory, RawArray, or mmap—all are limited by RAM bandwidth (typically 10-50 GB/s depending on system). Python adds negligible overhead at this scale. The 58x speedup over pickle isn't Python becoming faster, it's simply avoiding unnecessary work (serialization) that C would also need to avoid.

## Optimization checklist for production deployments

Start with algorithm selection: use shared memory approaches (SharedMemory, RawArray, mmap) for any data larger than a few kilobytes. Avoid multiprocessing.Queue and Pipe unless you need their messaging semantics—they add 10-100x overhead due to serialization. For queue-based workflows, faster-fifo provides queue semantics with near-shared-memory performance.

Implement lock-free patterns where possible. Single-writer-single-reader with atomic indices eliminates synchronization overhead entirely. Use the atomics library for process-safe atomic operations on shared memory. For multiple writers, measure whether lock contention is actually a bottleneck before implementing complex lock-free algorithms—multiprocessing.Lock is simple and adds only 1-2 microseconds if uncontended.

Apply CPU pinning for latency-sensitive processes. Pin producer and consumer to separate cores on the same NUMA node using `os.sched_setaffinity()`. Set process priorities with `os.nice(-5)` to reduce scheduling delays. On production systems, consider isolating cores using the `isolcpus` kernel parameter to dedicate cores exclusively to your processes. For hard real-time requirements, use Preempt-RT kernel patches and SCHED_FIFO priorities (test thoroughly to avoid system hangs).

Prevent false sharing by padding structures to 64-byte cache line boundaries. When using ctypes structures, add padding: `('_pad', ctypes.c_byte * (64 - field_size))` after each frequently-modified field. Verify alignment with `ctypes.addressof(obj) % 64 == 0`. For ring buffers, place write_index and read_index on separate cache lines to prevent cache ping-ponging between producer and consumer cores.

Monitor and measure actual performance. Use `time.perf_counter()` for microsecond-precision timing. Profile with Linux `perf` to measure cache misses and context switches: `perf stat -e cache-misses,context-switches python script.py`. High cache miss rates indicate poor locality or false sharing. High context switch rates suggest CPU contention or inadequate pinning. Adjust based on measurements rather than assumptions.

```

This example achieves 1-3 microsecond average latency on modern hardware by combining shared memory, cache-aligned structures, CPU pinning, and lock-free SWSR pattern. For even lower latency, integrate the atomics library for guaranteed atomic index updates, though the simple increment shown is sufficient for single-writer-single-reader scenarios on x86/x64 architectures.

## Final recommendations by use case

**For sharing a single float with minimal latency**: Use `multiprocessing.RawValue('f', 0.0)` which provides 100-300 nanosecond access with automatic cleanup and simple API. If you need cross-process access without parent-child relationship, use SharedMemory with struct packing—slightly more setup but still sub-microsecond performance.

**For high-throughput float arrays** (scientific computing, data processing): Use SharedMemory-backed NumPy arrays which achieve 100x speedup over serialization for large datasets. Initialize with `arr = np.ndarray(shape, dtype=np.float64, buffer=shm.buf)` and ensure in-place operations (`arr[:] = value`) to avoid copies.

**For queue-based message passing**: Replace multiprocessing.Queue with faster-fifo library for 30x performance improvement while maintaining familiar API. This is ideal when you need the message semantics (blocking get/put, buffering) but with much lower latency.

**For cross-language IPC** (Python communicating with C/C++ programs): Use posix_ipc for standardized POSIX shared memory and semaphores that any language can access. The small API surface and production stability make it reliable for heterogeneous systems.

**For ultra-low latency trading or real-time systems**: Combine SharedMemory with atomics library for lock-free ring buffer, CPU pinning to isolated cores, SCHED_FIFO priorities, and Preempt-RT kernel. This can achieve consistent sub-2-microsecond latency approaching C performance. Expect significant tuning effort and system configuration requirements.
