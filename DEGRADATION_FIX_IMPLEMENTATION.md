# ChronoTick 8-Hour Degradation Fix: Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Issue**: TimesFM prediction degradation after ~4 hours in 8-hour test
**Status**: ✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

---

## What Was Detected Wrong?

TimesFM performance degraded catastrophically after ~4 hours:

| Time Period | TimesFM Predicted | NTP Truth | Ratio | Status |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Hours 0-2   | 142.5ms          | 130.4ms   | 1.09x | ✓ Good |
| Hours 2-4   | 123.6ms          | 111.2ms   | 1.11x | ✓ Good |
| Hours 4-6   | 249.8ms          | 135.8ms   | 1.84x | ⚠️ Diverging |
| Hours 6-8   | 373.8ms          | 113.8ms   | 3.28x | ❌ Catastrophic |

**Key Finding**: TimesFM was OVERPREDICTING by 2-3x (not underpredicting). When NTP said "you need 120ms correction", TimesFM predicted "you need 500ms correction", causing massive overcorrection that accumulated error faster than the system clock.

---

## How Was This Detected? (Investigation Steps)

### Step 1: Initial Diagnostic Analysis

**File**: `scripts/analyze_ntp_correction_log.py`

```bash
cd /home/jcernuda/tick_project/ChronoTick
python scripts/analyze_ntp_correction_log.py
```

**Output**:
- Generated `diagnostic_analysis.png` showing:
  - ChronoTick error growing exponentially after hour 4
  - Dataset size growing unbounded (0 → 2800+ measurements)
  - Performance ratio degrading from 1.0x to 4.0x

**Key Insight**: Dataset contamination feedback loop suspected

### Step 2: Model Prediction Analysis

**File**: `scripts/analyze_model_predictions.py`

Created script to compare TimesFM predictions vs NTP ground truth:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_model_predictions.py
```

**Output**:
- Generated `model_prediction_analysis.png`
- Found mean prediction error: 146.0ms absolute (93.4ms signed)
- **CRITICAL**: TimesFM predicting 373.8ms when truth was 113.8ms by hours 6-8

**Key Insight**: Model is overpredicting, not underpredicting!

### Step 3: Root Cause Analysis

**Investigation**:
1. Reviewed `real_data_pipeline.py` line 1378-1385
2. Found: Every TimesFM prediction gets added to dataset, even bad ones
3. Identified: Bad predictions → contaminated training data → worse predictions
4. Discovered: No magnitude bounds or quality control on predictions

**Key Insight**: Dataset contamination feedback loop is the PRIMARY ROOT CAUSE

---

## What We Decided to Change?

We implemented **THREE CORE FIXES** to break the contamination feedback loop:

### Fix #1: Dataset Sliding Window ✅

**What**: Cap dataset size to prevent unbounded growth and contamination accumulation

**Implementation**:
- File: `server/src/chronotick/inference/real_data_pipeline.py`
- Location: `DatasetManager.__init__()` (line 285-294)
- Location: `DatasetManager.add_prediction()` (line 349-360)

**Code Changes**:
```python
# __init__
def __init__(self, max_dataset_size=1000):
    self.max_dataset_size = max_dataset_size  # FIX #1: Dataset sliding window

# add_prediction
if len(self.measurement_dataset) > self.max_dataset_size:
    # Remove oldest entries
    sorted_timestamps = sorted(self.measurement_dataset.keys())
    num_to_remove = len(self.measurement_dataset) - self.max_dataset_size
    timestamps_to_remove = sorted_timestamps[:num_to_remove]

    for ts in timestamps_to_remove:
        del self.measurement_dataset[ts]

    logger.info(f"[DATASET_SLIDING_WINDOW] ✂️ Trimmed dataset: removed {num_to_remove} old measurements")
```

**Config**: `configs/config_test_drift_aware.yaml`
```yaml
prediction_scheduling:
  dataset:
    max_history_size: 1000  # Keep last 1000 measurements
```

**Why**:
- Prevents ancient contamination from persisting
- Old bad predictions eventually expire
- More responsive to recent NTP corrections
- Dataset was growing to 2800+ entries (way beyond TimesFM's 100-300 context window)

---

### Fix #2: Adaptive Prediction Magnitude Capping ✅

**What**: Cap predictions relative to last NTP measurement + time elapsed (not absolute)

**Implementation**:
- File: `server/src/chronotick/inference/real_data_pipeline.py`
- Location: `RealDataPipeline.__init__()` (line 1098-1103) - config loading
- Location: `_apply_adaptive_capping()` (line 1481-1544) - helper method
- Location: `_get_predictive_correction()` (line 1416, 1445) - application

**Code Changes**:
```python
def _apply_adaptive_capping(self, correction: CorrectionWithBounds, current_time: float):
    """Cap predictions based on: last_ntp_magnitude + (time_since_ntp * max_drift_rate) + uncertainty_buffer"""

    time_since_ntp = current_time - self.last_ntp_time
    last_ntp_magnitude = abs(self.last_ntp_offset)

    max_allowed_magnitude = (last_ntp_magnitude +
                             (time_since_ntp * self.max_drift_rate) +
                             self.uncertainty_buffer)

    if abs(correction.offset_correction) > max_allowed_magnitude:
        # Cap prediction and reduce confidence
        capped_prediction = np.sign(correction.offset_correction) * max_allowed_magnitude
        capped_confidence = correction.confidence * 0.7
        logger.warning(f"[ADAPTIVE_CAP] ✂️ CAPPING PREDICTION: {original:.1f}ms → {capped:.1f}ms")
        return capped_correction
```

**Config**: `configs/config_test_drift_aware.yaml`
```yaml
prediction_scheduling:
  adaptive_capping:
    max_drift_rate: 0.005      # 5ms/s - max reasonable system drift
    uncertainty_buffer: 0.050  # 50ms - buffer for measurement uncertainty
```

**Why**:
- Allows legitimate large corrections when drift accumulates over time
- Prevents runaway predictions (500ms when truth is 120ms)
- Adapts to system behavior (more permissive when NTP is old)
- Still aggressive when NTP is recent (tight control)

---

### Fix #3: Confidence-Based Prediction Capping ✅

**What**: Cap low-confidence predictions more aggressively (ALWAYS add to maintain TimesFM spacing!)

**Implementation**:
- File: `server/src/chronotick/inference/real_data_pipeline.py`
- Location: `RealDataPipeline.__init__()` (line 1105-1114) - config loading
- Location: `_apply_confidence_based_capping()` (line 1563-1635) - helper method
- Location: `_get_predictive_correction()` (line 1419, 1448) - application

**Code Changes**:
```python
def _apply_confidence_based_capping(self, correction: CorrectionWithBounds):
    """Cap predictions based on confidence - ALWAYS add to maintain TimesFM spacing"""

    if confidence >= 0.8:
        # High confidence: Use as-is (already adaptive-capped)
        return correction
    elif confidence >= 0.5:
        # Medium confidence: Cap to 1.5x last NTP magnitude
        cap = last_ntp_magnitude * 1.5
    else:
        # Low confidence: Cap to 1.2x last NTP magnitude
        cap = last_ntp_magnitude * 1.2

    if abs(correction.offset_correction) > cap:
        logger.info(f"[CONFIDENCE_CAP] ✂️ CAPPING {level} CONFIDENCE PREDICTION")
        return capped_correction

    # ALWAYS add to dataset (maintains even spacing for TimesFM)
    return correction
```

**Config**: `configs/config_test_drift_aware.yaml`
```yaml
prediction_scheduling:
  confidence_capping:
    high_confidence_threshold: 0.8          # Use as-is above this
    medium_confidence_threshold: 0.5        # Medium confidence range
    medium_confidence_multiplier: 1.5       # Cap to 1.5x last NTP
    low_confidence_multiplier: 1.2          # Cap to 1.2x last NTP
```

**Why**:
- **CRITICAL**: TimesFM expects evenly-spaced data (freq=9 seconds assumption)
- Skipping predictions would break TimesFM's input assumptions
- Instead, we CAP predictions but ALWAYS add them to dataset
- Reduces contamination from uncertain predictions while preserving data spacing
- Progressive capping based on confidence level

---

## Why These Changes?

### The Contamination Feedback Loop

```
1. TimesFM predicts 400ms (when truth is 120ms)
2. That 400ms prediction gets stored in dataset
3. Next prediction uses dataset contaminated with 400ms error
4. Model produces WORSE prediction (500ms)
5. That 500ms gets stored → even worse next prediction
6. Repeat until catastrophic failure
```

**Our Fixes Break This Loop**:

1. **Sliding Window**: Old contaminated predictions expire (no infinite accumulation)
2. **Adaptive Capping**: Prevents 500ms prediction when truth is ~120ms (based on last NTP + time)
3. **Confidence Capping**: Reduces contamination from uncertain predictions while maintaining TimesFM spacing

---

## Enhanced Logging

All fixes include comprehensive logging to track effectiveness:

### Dataset Sliding Window Logging
```
[DATASET_SLIDING_WINDOW] ✂️ Trimmed dataset: removed 100 old measurements
[DATASET_SLIDING_WINDOW] Dataset now: 1000 entries (max=1000)
```

### Adaptive Capping Logging
```
[ADAPTIVE_CAP] ✂️ CAPPING PREDICTION:
  Original prediction: 450.2ms
  Capped to: 180.5ms
  Last NTP magnitude: 120.0ms
  Time since NTP: 45s
  Max allowed: 180.5ms
  Confidence: 0.85 → 0.60
```

### Confidence-Based Capping Logging
```
[CONFIDENCE_CAP] ✂️ CAPPING LOW CONFIDENCE PREDICTION:
  Confidence: 0.42 (LOW)
  Original prediction: 200.1ms
  Capped to: 144.0ms
  Last NTP magnitude: 120.0ms
  Cap multiplier: 1.2x
  Cap limit: 144.0ms
```

## How to Run Analysis Tomorrow (Verify Fixes)

### Step 1: Check Logs for Fix Activation

```bash
# Check if sliding window is active
grep "DATASET_SLIDING_WINDOW" tsfm/results/ntp_correction_experiment/overnight_8hr_*/chronotick.log

# Check if adaptive capping is working
grep "ADAPTIVE_CAP" tsfm/results/ntp_correction_experiment/overnight_8hr_*/chronotick.log

# Check if confidence capping is working
grep "CONFIDENCE_CAP" tsfm/results/ntp_correction_experiment/overnight_8hr_*/chronotick.log
```

**Expected Output**:
- Should see `[DATASET_SLIDING_WINDOW]` logs showing dataset trimmed to 1000 entries
- Should see `[ADAPTIVE_CAP]` logs showing predictions capped when exceeding thresholds
- Should see `[CONFIDENCE_CAP]` logs showing low-confidence predictions capped

---

### Step 2: Run Model Prediction Analysis

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /home/jcernuda/tick_project/ChronoTick

# Update script with new data directory
# Edit: scripts/analyze_model_predictions.py
# Line 179: data_dir = Path("tsfm/results/ntp_correction_experiment/overnight_8hr_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS")

# Run analysis
python scripts/analyze_model_predictions.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
======================================================================
PREDICTION ERROR BY TIME PERIOD
======================================================================

Hours 0-2 (XX measurements):
  TimesFM predicted: 125.0 ms
  NTP truth: 120.0 ms
  Prediction error: 8.5 ms
  Ratio (predicted/truth): 1.04  ← Should stay < 1.5x

Hours 2-4 (XX measurements):
  TimesFM predicted: 130.0 ms
  NTP truth: 125.0 ms
  Prediction error: 10.2 ms
  Ratio (predicted/truth): 1.04  ← Should stay < 1.5x

Hours 4-6 (XX measurements):
  TimesFM predicted: 140.0 ms
  NTP truth: 135.0 ms
  Prediction error: 12.5 ms
  Ratio (predicted/truth): 1.04  ← Should stay < 1.5x (NOT 1.84x like before!)

Hours 6-8 (XX measurements):
  TimesFM predicted: 145.0 ms
  NTP truth: 140.0 ms
  Prediction error: 15.0 ms
  Ratio (predicted/truth): 1.04  ← Should stay < 1.5x (NOT 3.28x like before!)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- **Ratio should stay < 1.5x throughout entire 8-hour test**
- Previously: 1.09x → 1.11x → 1.84x → 3.28x ❌
- Target: 1.05x → 1.08x → 1.15x → 1.25x ✅

---

### Step 3: Run Diagnostic Analysis

```bash
# Run diagnostic analysis
python scripts/analyze_ntp_correction_log.py
```

**Expected Output**:
- `diagnostic_analysis.png` should show:
  - ChronoTick error staying flat or growing slowly (NOT exponentially)
  - Performance ratio staying near 1.0 (NOT rising to 4.0)
  - Dataset size capped at 1000 entries (NOT growing to 2800+)

---

### Step 4: Compare Accumulated Errors

```bash
# Compare final accumulated errors
grep "Accumulated error" tsfm/results/ntp_correction_experiment/overnight_8hr_*/summary*.csv
```

**Baseline (Before Fixes)**:
- ChronoTick: 21,400ms accumulated error
- System Clock: 18,900ms accumulated error
- Result: ChronoTick WORSE than system clock ❌

**Target (After Fixes)**:
- ChronoTick: < 15,000ms accumulated error
- System Clock: ~18,900ms accumulated error
- Result: ChronoTick BETTER than system clock ✅

---

### Step 5: Verify Dataset Size

```bash
# Check dataset size in logs
grep "Dataset size" tsfm/results/ntp_correction_experiment/overnight_8hr_*/chronotick.log | tail -20
```

**Expected**: Dataset should stabilize at 1000 entries (not grow unbounded to 2800+)
